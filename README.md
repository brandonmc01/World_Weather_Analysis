# World Weather Analysis

## Overview

### Background
I have been working on the code for PlanMyTrip app. A few changes were needed to add functionality to the app allowing it to plan trip routes and filter hotels at locations based on user input for their weather preferences.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create four different deliverables.
1. Dataframe containing  weather information for random cities around the world.
2. Dataframe containing closest hotels to cities filtered by users weather preferences.
3. Map showing hotels in locations filtered by users weather preferences with markers for weather conditions.
4. Travel maps showing the functionality of the route planning feature of the app.
